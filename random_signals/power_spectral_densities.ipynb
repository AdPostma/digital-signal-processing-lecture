For a better interpretation of the PSD, the frequency axis $f = \\frac{\\Omega}{2 \\pi} \\cdot f_s$ has been chosen for illustration, where $f_s$ denotes the sampling frequency of the signal. \n",

When computing the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of the ACF numerically by the fast Fourier transform (FFT) one has to take this shift into account.
