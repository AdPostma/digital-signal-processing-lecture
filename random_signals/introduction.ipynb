    "Random signals play an important role in various fields of signal processing and communications. This is due to the fact that only random signals carry information. A signal which is observed by a receiver has to be unknown to some degree in order to represent novel [information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information).\n",

    "Random signals are often classified as useful/desired and disturbing/interfering signals. For instance\n",
    "\n",
    "* useful signals: data, speech, music, images, ...\n",
    "* disturbing signals: thermal noise at a resistor, amplifier noise, quantization noise, cosmic microwave background...\n",
    "\n",
    "Practical signals are frequently modeled as a combination of useful signals and additive noise.\n",

    "As the values of a random signal cannot be foreseen, the properties of random signals are described by the their statistical characteristics. One measure is for instance the average value of a random signal."
