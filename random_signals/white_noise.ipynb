    "[White noise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_noise) is a wide-sense stationary (WSS) random signal with constant power spectral density (PSD)\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\Phi_{xx}(\\mathrm{e}^{\\,\\mathrm{j}\\, \\Omega}) = N_0\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $N_0$ denotes the power per frequency. White noise draws its name from the analogy to white light. It refers typically to an idealized model of a random signal, e.g. emerging from measurement noise. The auto-correlation function (ACF) of white noise can be derived by inverse discrete-time Fourier transformation (DTFT) of the PSD\n",

    "\n",
    "This result implies that white noise has to be a zero-mean random process. It can be concluded from the ACF that two neighboring samples $k$ and $k+1$ are uncorrelated. Hence they show no dependencies in the statistical sense. Although this is often assumed, the probability density function (PDF) of white noise is not necessarily given by the normal distribution. In general, it is required to additionally state the amplitude distribution when denoting a signal as white noise."
