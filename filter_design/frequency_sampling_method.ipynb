The magnitude response of the designed filter approximates this only very coarsely and shows major ringing artifacts. The phase of the designed filter is also not zero for all frequencies. Increasing the length `N` of the filter does not improve the attenuation in the stop-band, it only changes the frequencies of the local minima of the ripples. The reason for the poor performance of the designed filter is the zero-phase of the desired transfer function which cannot be realized by a causal non-recursive system.

    "Solution: Comparison of above results to the window method (with a rectangular window) reveals that both provide a similar performance in terms of achievable stop-band attenuation. Increasing `M` in above example does not result in obvious changes since the initial choice constitutes already a high amount of oversampling. However, decreasing `M` till it is the range of the filter length `N` results in a smooth degradation of the performance towards the original (not oversampled) frequency sampling method. In the chosen example the passband ripple and side lobe level increase when decreasing `M`."
