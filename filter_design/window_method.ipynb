    "## Design of Non-Recursive Filters using the Window Method\n",
    "\n",
    "The design of non-recursive filters with a finite-length impulse response (FIR) is a frequent task in practical applications. The designed filter should approximate a prescribed frequency response as close as possible. First, the design of causal filters is considered. For many applications the resulting filter should have a linear phase characteristic since this results in a constant (frequency independent) group delay. We therefore specialize the design to causal linear-phase filters in a second step."
